## About Rohit Menon.

- My journey through the world of engineering and robotics has been both exhilarating and incredibly rewarding. It all started with a genuine fascination for how things work, leading me into the field of 
  mechanical engineering. There, I fell in love with the process of designing and manufacturing, discovering the sheer joy of turning abstract ideas into tangible, working systems. It was challenging, sure, but 
  seeing my designs come to life was thrilling.

- As my career progressed, I couldn't help but be drawn to the next frontier: robotics and automation. It felt like a natural step, fueled by my curiosity to explore how much further we could push technology. 
  Learning to code and getting to grips with embedded systems felt like unlocking a new level of creativity. I was hooked.

- My passion didn't stop there. I decided to deepen my expertise with a master's in robotics and autonomous systems, focusing on systems engineering. Diving into machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, 
  convolutional neural networks, and computer vision wasn't easy. It required a lot of late nights and moments of frustration, but it was worth it. Each project, each breakthrough, felt like a victory, opening 
  my eyes to the incredible potential of autonomous systems.

- I'm not just saying this because it sounds good, I truly am passionate about this stuff. My journey from mechanical engineering to robotics isn't just a career path, it's a reflection of my genuine passion for 
  innovation and the endless possibilities that technology brings. It's been a challenging journey, but honestly, I can't imagine doing anything else.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE.

- Job Position: Graduate Service Assistant - Lab Assistant/Grader with a focus on two courses (Robotic System - 1 and Mechatronic Systems)  
- Company: Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University
- Location: Mesa, Arizona, USA
- Type of Work: On–site
- Employment Duration: August 2023 – December 2023

- As a Graduate Service Assistant (GSA), I had the opportunity to work closely with two leading figures in the field of Robotics and Autonomous systems. One served as the Program Chair of Robotics and Autonomous   Systems, now holding the position of Associate Director and Professor. The second holds the esteemed position of Associate Dean and President's Professor. Under their mentorship, I played a significant role in 
  educating and mentoring 115 students across two pivotal courses: Robotics Systems - 1 and Mechatronic Systems. My teaching encompassed foundational elements of Python programming and (ROS), expanding to 
  include simulations using tools such as RoboDK and Polyscope.

- My contributions were particularly notable in the development and execution of two projects that significantly enhanced the student’s hands-on learning experience. The first project, "Advanced Robotics 
  Automation, Optimization, and Programming of an Elephant Robotics MYCOBOT. This project concentrated on tasks such as arm calibration, forward and inverse kinematics, color recognition, and YOLO object 
  detection. I developed a Python controller for Elephant Robotics, allowing the robot to engage in and autonomously reset tic-tac-toe games with humans. The second project, "Advanced Robotic Manipulation and 
  Programming of a Universal Robot (UR3e/UR5e) Series," catered to both courses and centered on robotic manipulation, enhancing spatial dynamics, precision, gripper calibration, and conducting tests in 
  navigation, straightness, and repeatability. It improved processes in pick-and-place palletizing and flashlight assembly, fostering a deeper understanding of robotic manipulations among the students.

- These initiatives enriched students practical robotics skills. My role involved curating the curriculum and managing the high-tech lab, ensuring access to the latest technology and learning methods.
