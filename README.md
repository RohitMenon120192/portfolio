- Company: Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University
- Location: Mesa, Arizona, USA
- Type of Work: On–site
- Employment Duration: August 2023 – December 2023

- Key Achievements:

- As a Graduate Service Assistant (GSA), I collaborated closely with two prominent academics in robotics and autonomous systems. These collaborations occurred within their respective roles: one as the Program 
  Chair of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, later Associate Director and Professor, and the other as Associate Dean and President's Professor. My responsibilities included teaching and mentoring 115 students in 
  two courses, "Robotics Systems - 1" and "Mechatronic Systems". The curriculum I delivered covered essential Python programming and Robotics Operating System (ROS), along with simulation tools like RoboDK and 
  Polyscope.

- My work was instrumental in designing and implementing two key projects aimed at enhancing hands-on learning in robotics. The first project involved integrating artificial intelligence with a 6-DOF MYCOBOT 
  (280) from Elephant Robotics, focusing on calibration and manipulation, forwars kinematics and inverse kinematics, color recognition, and YOLO object detection. I created a Python-based controller for the 
  robot, enabling it to play and autonomously reset tic-tac-toe games with participants. The second project involved advanced programming and system integration for collaborative robots (COBOTS) in manufacturing 
  automation, utilizing the 6-DOF Universal Robots (UR3/e and UR5/CB-3) series. This project addressed robotic manipulation, spatial dynamics, precision, and conducted tests in navigation and repeatability, 
  applied in tasks like palletizing and assembly.

- These projects contributed to improving student's understanding and skills in robotics. Additionally, I was responsible for curating the curriculum and managing a high-tech laboratory, ensuring students had 
  access to current technology and educational resources.

- Details of these activities and other contributions are documented in my GitHub Profile, Portfolio and YouTube Channel.

- Additionally, I played a key role in organizing and participating in an event at the Robotics Automation and Rapid Prototyping Lab, which focused on leveraging technology for industrial manufacturing 
  automation. The highlight of the event was the simultaneous operation of 15 robotic arms, a spectacle that underscored the significance of advanced manufacturing technologies.
  
- This memorable showcase, known as the Manufacturing Automation Technology Open House, welcomed over 60 students from various fields and campuses, alongside a delightful robotic dog, making the event even more 
  engaging.
  
- One of the standout moments was the opportunity to present our newest collection of robotic arms, which are ideally suited for a wide array of manufacturing tasks. Our team of graduate students also took great 
  pleasure in instructing attendees on programming collaborative robots (cobots) for effective teamwork in the workspace.
  
- The Open House featured an impressive array of technologies, from CNC machines and a robotic arm specialized in welding, to five distinct types of robots - not to mention the presence of a robotic dog!
